It can lead to a resource exhaustion vulnerability when using attacker-controlled inputs. The memory leak occurs in the function located at `github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113`, where the objects `pkey` and `ctx` are not properly freed during error cases. Specifically, the function's named return parameters set `pkey` and `ctx` to nil, but error-related return statements follow the pattern `return nil, nil, fail(...)`. As a result, the deferred cleanup function does not release these resources, potentially causing the memory leak."

The vulnerability arises from the SSH service being enabled by default and the presence of a hidden, undocumented, hard-coded support account with a password based on the device's MAC address. Because all internet interfaces of the devices share a similar MAC address that only varies in the final octet, network-adjacent attackers can derive the support user's SSH password by decrementing the final octet of the connected gateway address or via the BSSID. This vulnerability potentially allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root-level privileges.

This vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in all versions up to and including version 2.0.1. It arises due to the incorrect use of the `wp_kses_allowed_html` function, which permits the use of the `'onclick'` attribute for certain HTML elements without adequate restriction or validation. As a result, unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which then execute whenever a user accesses those pages."

Specifically, processing a crafted image can trigger a buffer over-read of 1 byte in the `read_iptc_profile` function within the `Source/Metadata/IPTC.cpp` file. This occurs because the size of the profile is not properly sanitized, resulting in a crash of the application linked to the library and causing a denial of service."

        "Advanced_RAG_GPT-4o-mini": "CVE-2024-9050 describes a vulnerability in the `libreswan` client plugin for NetworkManager (`NetworkManager-libreswan`). The flaw lies in the plugin's failure to properly sanitize the VPN configuration from a local unprivileged user. The configuration, provided in a key-value format, doesn't escape special characters, allowing values to be misinterpreted as keys. A particularly exploitable parameter is the `leftupdown` key, which takes an executable command as a value used as a callback in `NetworkManager-libreswan`.Due to `NetworkManager` using Polkit to allow unprivileged users to control network settings, a malicious actor could exploit this by creating a malicious configuration, potentially leading to local privilege escalation and code execution as root on the targeted machine."

The vulnerability exists in the file `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Intelbras\\Incontrol Cliente\\incontrol_webcam\\incontrol-service-watchdog.exe` and is caused by an unquoted search path issue. This allows local attackers to exploit the vulnerability. Upgrading to version 2.21.58 addresses the issue. The vendor was informed about the vulnerability on August 5, 2024, and planned to release a fix by the end of August 2024, but it was postponed to September 20, 2024. It is advised to upgrade to the fixed version to mitigate this issue."
