We are republishing CVE-2013-3900 in the Security Update Guide to update the Security Updates table and to inform customers that the EnableCertPaddingCheck is available in all currently supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11. While the format is different from the original CVE published in 2013, the information herein remains unchanged from the original text published on December 10, 2013. Microsoft does not plan to enforce the stricter verification behavior as a default functionality on supported releases of Microsoft Windows. This behavior remains available as an opt-in feature via reg key setting, and is available on supported editions of Windows released since December 10, 2013. This includes all currently supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11. The supporting code for this reg key was incorporated at the time of release for Windows 10 and Windows 11, so no security update is required; however, the reg key must be set. See the Security Updates table for the list of affected software. Vulnerability Description A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the WinVerifyTrust function handles Windows Authenticode signature verification for portable executable (PE) files. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by modifying an existing signed executable file to leverage unverified portions of the file in such a way as to add malicious code to the file without invalidating the signature. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user or application run or install a specially crafted, signed PE file. An attacker could modify an existing signed file to include malicious code without invalidating the signature. This code would...

An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:  In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email. In a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to open the document file.  The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows font library handles embedded fonts. "

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file. Note that where severity is indicated as Critical in the Affected Products table, the Preview Pane is an attack vector. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Outlook handles objects in memory. "

The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. . Was ZDI-CAN-20417."

Prior to version 2024.07.01, `yt-dlp` does not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to aribitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` also reads config from the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executed from the yt-dlp directory) this could lead to arbitrary code being executed. `yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting the allowed extensions. This might mean some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded, however it will also limit the possible exploitation surface. In addition to upgrading, have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template and make sure the user trusts the websites that they are downloading from. Also, make sure to never download to a directory within PATH or other sensitive locations like one's user directory, `system32`, or other binaries locations. For users who are not able to upgrade, keep the default output template (`-o \"%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`); make sure the extension of the media to download is a common video/audio/sub/... one; try to avoid the generic extractor; and/or use `--ignore-config --config-location ...` to not load config from common locations.",

When a BGP UPDATE with malformed path attribute is received over an established BGP session, rpd crashes and restarts.   Continuous receipt of a BGP UPDATE with a specifically malformed path attribute will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices. While this issue affects systems running 32-bit and 64-bit systems, the probability of impact on 64-bit system is extremely low.  According to  KB25803  https://supportportal.juniper.net/s/article/Junos-How-to-check-if-Junos-OS-is-64-or-32-bit-on-a-router , customers can confirm 32-bit or 64-bit system via the ' show version detail ' command:         lab@router> show version detail| match 32      JUNOS 32-bit kernel Software Suite        lab@router> show version detail| match 64      JUNOS 64-bit kernel Software Suite    This issue affects:   Juniper Networks Junos OS:     *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8,    *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4,    *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3,    *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1,    *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2, 23.4R2.    Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,    *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4-EVO,    *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1-EVO,    *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO."
