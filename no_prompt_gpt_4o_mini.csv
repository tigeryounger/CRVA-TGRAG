0,What is CVE-2013-3900,"CVE-2013-3900 is a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint that allows for elevation of privileges. It occurs because of improper validation of web requests, which could permit an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The vulnerability affects various SharePoint versions, and successful exploitation could enable an attacker to take control of the affected system. Microsoft addressed this issue in their security updates, and users are encouraged to apply the latest patches to mitigate any risks associated with this vulnerability. Security best practices, such as regular updates and monitoring, are essential to protect against such vulnerabilities.","Why is Microsoft republishing a CVE from 2013? We are republishing CVE-2013-3900 in the Security Update Guide to update the Security Updates table and to inform customers that the EnableCertPaddingCheck is available in all currently supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11. While the format is different from the original CVE published in 2013, the information herein remains unchanged from the original text published on December 10, 2013. Microsoft does not plan to enforce the stricter verification behavior as a default functionality on supported releases of Microsoft Windows. This behavior remains available as an opt-in feature via reg key setting, and is available on supported editions of Windows released since December 10, 2013. This includes all currently supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11. The supporting code for this reg key was incorporated at the time of release for Windows 10 and Windows 11, so no security update is required; however, the reg key must be set. See the Security Updates table for the list of affected software. Vulnerability Description A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the WinVerifyTrust function handles Windows Authenticode signature verification for portable executable (PE) files. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by modifying an existing signed executable file to leverage unverified portions of the file in such a way as to add malicious code to the file without invalidating the signature. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user or application run or install a specially crafted, signed PE file. An attacker could modify an existing signed file to include malicious code without invalidating the signature. This code would...

1,What is CVE-2013-6040,"CVE-2013-6040 is a vulnerability that affects the Apple iOS operating system, specifically impacting the handling of certain NSURL requests. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device due to improper validation of input. Exploitation could occur through the delivery of a malicious URL that could trigger unexpected behavior, potentially leading to a crash or unauthorized access. Although this CVE was reported in 2013, it underscores the importance of timely software updates and security patches to mitigate such vulnerabilities. Users are advised to keep their devices updated to the latest versions to protect against known exploits.","MW6 Aztec, DataMatrix, and MaxiCode ActiveX controls before version 4.0 vulnerable to arbitrary code via a crafted HTML document.

2,What is CVE-2015-10123,"CVE-2015-10123 is a vulnerability found in the OpenSSL library, specifically concerning the handling of certain ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) encoding. Discovered in December 2015, the issue allows an attacker to execute a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by manipulating crafted ASN.1 data, leading to an infinite loop in OpenSSL's parsing of this data. This vulnerability primarily affects versions of OpenSSL prior to 1.0.2g and 1.1.0, as later updates patched the issue. Although it does not allow for remote code execution or data leakage, it poses a significant risk for services utilizing vulnerable OpenSSL versions, as it can cause service disruptions. Users are advised to upgrade to patched versions to mitigate the risk.",An unautheticated remote attacker could send specifically crafted packets to a affected device.
