This would lead to application crash and, if the application uses the defective pointer for further data access, could cause the application to drop private random memory to the network. NOTE: this is disputed by Glibc. The vendor has disputed this because the getaddrinfo() function does not use user-controlled data as a buffer address. Instead, it uses a stack-allocated buffer and then copies data from user-controlled structures into that buffer.

According to the Mitre Corporation's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list, CVE-2020-17031 is a security vulnerability affecting the Expat (Expat XML Parser) library. The vulnerability was reported by Thomas Clark and J√∂rn Janzer and was fixed in Expat version 2.2.10. The issue arises because Expat's XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber function does not properly initialize its internal variables, which can lead to a use-after-free error when called after a certain sequence of XML parser operations has completed. Expired SSL certificates were used as a trigger for the out-of-bounds read in the affected function. This could lead to memory corruption and thus should be fixed promptly. The Expat team recommends updating to version 2.2.10 or later to resolve this issue.",
        "Mistral-CVE": "\n\nCVE-2020-17031, also known as Sunshine, is a zero-day vulnerability found in Google's Fonts service. It allows attackers with administrator privileges on a network to push malicious fonts to all users on the network, potentially executing malicious code when these fonts are rendered. This is possible due to how Windows handles TrueType Font (TTF) and OpenType Font (OTF) files, which can contain embedded executable code. The vulnerability exists because Google Fonts serves its fonts as TTF/OTF files, and the Windows Operating System (OS) does not adequately validate these files before execution. This issue was addressed in Microsoft's November 2020 security updates."

The exploitation of this vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) on systems with MSDT enabled. This tool is used by support agents to diagnose and resolve issues, making it widely available on many Windows systems.\n\n2. The exploit uses Application Protocol Interface (API) calls to load malicious content from a specially crafted document, such as a Word file or an email attachment. This technique is known as Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE).\n\n3. Once the malicious content is loaded, it triggers the execution of PowerShell commands, enabling attackers to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the targeted system.\n\n4. The vulnerability exists due to improper validation of user input in MSDT, allowing attackers to manipulate the tool and execute malicious code.\n\n5. To mitigate this risk, Microsoft recommends disabling the loading of DDE macros from the internet and local intranet sites by modifying the Group Policy settings or registry entries on affected systems. Additionally, updating MSDT to version 1.ff.104.2003 (for x64-based systems) or version 1.ff.98.2003 (for Itanium-based systems) will address this issue."

        "Mistral-CVE": "\n\nCVE-2024-47906, also known as \"Fermium,\" is a recently disclosed vulnerability in the Arm Cortex-M processor family. This zero-day exploit allows local attackers with write access to the flash memory of an affected device to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code at the highest privilege level (Supervisor/Thread 0). The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of the MPU (Memory Protection Unit) during exception entry. This issue is particularly concerning because it affects a wide range of devices, including microcontrollers used in IoT (Internet of Things), automotive, and industrial systems. Upgrading firmware to versions that have addressed this vulnerability is recommended to mitigate the risk."

According to the Mitre Corporation's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list, CVE-2024-48231 is a security flaw affecting the \"httpoxy\" directive in the Apache HTTP Server (httpd). The vulnerability allows web application developers to create a malicious configuration that can lead to privilege escalation on the server. This occurs when a web application uses user-controlled data to set the value of the \"proxy\" variable, which is then used to set the value of the \"X_PROXY_SCHEME\" environment variable. If the \"httpoxy\" directive is enabled in the Apache configuration, this can allow the attacker-controlled scheme (e.g., \"http\" or \"https\") to be used for requests made by the web application, potentially allowing the attacker to perform HTTP requests as if they were made by the web server itself. This could lead to unauthorized access to internal systems or data. The vulnerability was fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and 2.0.64.",

The vulnerability allows web application developers to create a malicious configuration that can lead to privilege escalation on the server. This occurs when a user-controlled HTTP proxy request header is used with the \"Proxy\" or \"proxy\" keyword, which can cause the server to use the specified proxy for requests to the /_proxy/ directory and its subdirectories. If exploited successfully, this could allow attackers controlled access to internal network resources.
