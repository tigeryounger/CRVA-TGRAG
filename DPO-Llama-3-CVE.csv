Vulnerability Description A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the WinVerifyTrust function handles Windows Authenticode signature verification for portable executable (PE) files. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by modifying an existing signed executable file to leverage unverified portions of the file in such a way as to add malicious code to the file without invalidating the signature. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user or application run or install a specially crafted, signed PE file.

This flaw allows malicious TCP/IP stack buffer content conclusion on adding out-of-user-memory addresses to in-scraping in getaddrinfo() (and possibly other functions) because it calls on corrupted user-data as contained in structures that live below the heap. This would lead to application crash and, if the application uses the defective pointer for further data access, could cause the application to drop private random memory to the network. NOTE: this is disputed by Glibc. The vendor has disputed this because the getaddrinfo() function does not use user-controlled data as a buffer address. Instead, it uses a stack-allocated buffer and then copies data from user-controlled structures into that buffer. This means that even if the application's memory is corrupted, the getaddrinfo() function cannot be forced to access private random memory.

411,What is CVE-2023-0636,"I'd be happy to provide you with information on CVE-2023-0636! According to the Mitre Corporation's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list, CVE-2023-0636 is a ""Vuln Record"" that was assigned to a ""Split Assignment"" of multiple related security vulnerabilities affecting the Apache Log4j 2 component.
The split assignment was made because the original CVE-2005-2969, which was previously associated with the Log4j 1.x series, was re-assigned to cover the same class of vulnerability (Carlo Roviri's ""JNDI Lookups allow manipulation of logged messages for attack on application logger"" from 2004) in Apache Log4j 2.0 through 2.14.0 and from 2.15.0 to 2.16.0, affecting all supported versions of Log4j 2.x.
This vulnerability allows attackers who can control log messages (such as from web application user-input) to execute arbitrary code in the security context of the Java application making a call to Log4j for logging (other than when the attacker-controlled logs are propogated from one module to another within the same application).

All of this happened before Polkit authentication was even started. The dnf5 library code does not check whether non-root users control the directory in question.  On one hand, this poses a Denial-of-Service attack vector by making the daemonoperate on a blocking file (e.g. named FIFO special file) or a very large file that causes an out-of-memory situation (e.g. /dev/zero). On the other hand, this can be used to let the daemon process privileged files like /etc/shadow. The file in question is parsed as an INI file. Error diagnostics resulting from parsing privileged files could cause information leaks, if these diagnostics are accessible to unprivileged users.

According to the Mitre Corporation's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list, CVE-2024-47823 is a security flaw affecting the ""httpoxy"" directive in the Apache HTTP Server (httpd). The vulnerability allows web application developers to create a malicious configuration that can lead to privilege escalation on the server. This occurs when a web application uses user-controlled data to construct an HTTP proxy request, allowing attackers controlled by the web application to set arbitrary headers in the proxied request. If the ""X-Forwarded-Host"" (XFH) header is not properly sanitized, it can be used to modify the document base for requests with a URL starting with ""/"". This allows the attacker-controlled server to read files outside of the web root on the target server. The vulnerability was fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and 2.0.64.","Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that allows for dynamic UI components without leaving PHP. In livewire/livewire prior to `2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a “.php” file extension. If the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack: 1. Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`. 2. Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk. 3. Webserver is configured to execute “.php” files. This issue has been addressed in release versions `2.12.7` and `3.5.2`.
